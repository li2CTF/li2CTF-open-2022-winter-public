Our sysadmin, Siraj Mahmud (who knows russian language), writes and types so fast, that he makes a ton of mistakes. And here is the apogee of his problem - he didn't notice he wrote the message on the wrong keyboard layout. The problem is that this message possess instructions (eng, probably) for his assistant during Siraj's vacation. We have no idea what he wanted to say, please help us!
